### _Understanding those three letter airport codes_

Every airport is identified by a unique three-letter IATA code. Some codes are straightforward if you know the city or airport name, while others can be quite puzzling.

Turns out, there's usually a logical explanation behind each code. Understanding the meaning of each IATA code isn't essential, but it can definitely be enjoyable.

### About

Airport Codes PH is a website about Philippine Airports, its corresponding airport codes and the explanation behind each code.
